Prerequisites

You will need Python on your machine at the very least. Please see the following for your OS type : [Linux](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.6/Python-2.7.6.tgz) | [Mac OS X](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.6/python-2.7.6-macosx10.6.dmg) | [Windows](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.6/python-2.7.6.msi)

I'm not 100% certain about stuff beyond that, but if you are having issues feel free to contact me. 

Basics
=====

After running the script, you will be prompted to login to reddit, enter your username, then your password when prompted. Next you should be asked for a reddit username to search for. Enter it without the '/u/' . After entering it, the script will run and may take some time, it will let you know when its done. That's it.
